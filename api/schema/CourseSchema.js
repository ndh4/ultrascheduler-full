/**
 * THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINE HERE - IT TOOK ALMOST 2 WEEKS TO GET THIS RIGHT
 * PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE
 * THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO RELATIONS WHEN YOU HAVE A SUBFIELD THAT IS A SEPARATE 
 * MONGO COLLECTION WHICH LINKS TO THE CURRENT MONGO COLLECTION ON ONE FIELD; YOU JUST HAVE TO 
 * DO THIS AND USE THE "source._id" in the "resolve" field (and projection of that _id in the "projection" field) 
 * Inspired from: https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose/issues/176
